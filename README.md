## CS 360V Virtualization (Fall 2021)

Welcome to CS 360V Virtualization for undergrads. This is a course designed to expose undergraduate students to the latest in virtualization technologies such as virtual machines, containers, serverless, etc. The course also has two significant project components to be completed over the course of the semester.

 This course will introduce students to
  a range of exciting topics including:
  <ul>
    <li>Basics of Virtual Machines</li>
    <li>Basics of Containers</li>
    <li>How CPU is Virtualized</li>
    <li>How Storage is Virtualized</li>
    <li>How Network is Virtualized</li>
    <li>Nested Virtualization</li>
    <li>Hardware Features Assisting Virtualization</li>
    <li>Deploying Virtual Machines</li>
    <li>Orchestrating Containers</li>
     <li>How serverless works</li>
  </ul>

Aside from teaching you the concepts behind virtualization, this course is meant to get you familiar with the commonly used tools and software. You should get used to using virtual machines, and containers. You will gain more experience with Git, and with real-world code bases.

### Grading 

**25%** Midterm 1 <br>
**25%** Midterm 2 <br>

**25%** Project: modifying a hypervisor <br>
**25%** Project: contributing to an open-source repository related to virtualization <br>

### Extra Credit

You can earn upto **1%** extra credit if your patches get accepted to any open-source repository related to virtualization. 

**0.5%**: Any patch at all, no restrictions, could be a one line fix to a simple bug.<br>
**0.5%**: This needs to be a more substantial patch, requiring technical thought and care. 

Note that these extra-credit activities will also serve you well in hunting for jobs or internships: getting a patch accepted in a project is impressive.

### Reading

These books are not required, but are useful for the class. The same information is also available freely online.

### Projects

<p>There will be two big projects in the course. Students will work in
  groups of two or three for both projects. Students can have different teams for each project.</p>

<p>The first project will involve modifying an existing
  hypervisor to add certain features. You will need to know the basics of operating systems,
  C, and assembly to complete this project. README for project one, lab-1:
  https://github.com/vijay03/cs360v-f21/blob/master/Lab1.md </p>

<p>The second project is open-ended, and will involve adding a new
  feature to any open-source project related to virtualization and
  containers. Students will propose what they want to do, get the
  proposal approved, and then present on what they did at the end of
  the semester. You are encouraged to add a useful feature to an
  open-source project (and potentially get it merged with the code
  base). More details here: https://github.com/vijay03/cs360v-f21/blob/master/project-open-source.md. 
</p>

<p>More details about the projects will be added shortly.</p>

### Course Policies

<p>Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community
Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259,
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/">http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/</a>.</p>

<p><b>Religious Holy Days</b>: A student who is absent from an
examination or cannot meet an assignment deadline due to the
observance of a religious holy day may take the exam on an alternate
day or submit the assignment up to 24 hours late without penalty, if
proper notice of the planned absence has been given. Notice must be
given at least 14 days prior to the classes which will be missed. For
religious holy days that fall within the first 2 weeks of the
semester, notice should be given on the first day of the
semester. Notice must be personally delivered to the instructor and
signed and dated by the instructor, or sent certified mail. Email
notification will be accepted if received, but a student submitting
email notification must receive email confirmation from the
instructor.</p>

#### Collaboration 

1. The students are encouraged to do the projects in groups of two or three.
3. Each student must present.
4. I strongly encourage you to discuss the projects and assignments with
anyone you can. That's the way good science happens. But all work and
writeup for the assignment must be your own, and only your own.
5. As a professional, you should acknowledge significant contributions or
collaborations in your written or spoken presentations.
6. The student code of conduct
is <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html">here</a>. Intellectual
dishonesty can end your career, and it is your responsibility to stay
on the right side of the line. If you are not sure about something,
  ask.
7. **The penalty for cheating on an exam, project or assignment in
    this course is an F in the course and a referral to the Dean of
    Students office.**
8. You cross over from collaboration to cheating when you look at
    another person/team's source code. **Discussing ideas is okay,
  sharing code is not**.
9. You also may not look at any course project material relating to
  any project similar to or the same as this course's class
  projects. For example, you may not look at the work done by a
  student in past years' courses, and you may not look at similar
  course projects at other universities.
10. All submitted work must be new and original.

#### Late Policy

1. All projects/assignments must be submitted in class the day they
are due.
2. For each day a project/assignment is late, you lose 5% of the
  points for that project. So if you submit two days after the
  deadline, your maximum points on that project will be 90%.
3. In this class, it is always better to do the work (even late) than not
do it at all.
4. If you become ill: contact the instructor. A medical note is
 required to miss an exam.
